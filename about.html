			The mesmeric visuals of Rob Lowe <em>(aka Supermundane)</em> have become an instantly recognisable feature of the contemporary design landscape. His signature geometric drawings, known for their playful use of colour, line and optical effects, have been commissioned for almost every kind of setting. Whether he’s designing a permanent mural for Leeds train station, collaborating on a bespoke rug, or making a site-specific installation for the children of Great Ormond Street Hospital, Rob’s work is always infused with his distinctive humor and hyper-colorful imagination. Prolific in output, with a portfolio spanning over 20 years, his work has been published and exhibited worldwide. 
			<br>
			<br>
			He lives and works in Havelock Walk, an artists’ community in South East London.
